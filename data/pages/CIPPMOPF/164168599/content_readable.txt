[TABLE]
  | To improve transparency and communication between project stakeholders, a new email notification has been introduced for resource managers. The daily notification is sent to the resource's manager when another user (different from the direct manager) newly allocates one of their team members to a project or idea. The email is intended as information only and requires no action in ProPM. As such, the email is also sent to managers who don't have access to ProPM at this time . In case of any questions, concerns or necessary adjustments, reach out directly to the project manager and/or the author of the allocation (clicking on the email address opens a new Outlook email).
