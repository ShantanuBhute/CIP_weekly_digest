## Definition of RACI

RACI is an acronym representing different roles in task completion. While there are various versions of this model, the key is to clearly define each role. Here&rsquo;s what each letter stands for:

  • R = Responsible : This is the task lead &ndash; the person ultimately responsible for completing the job. There should be only one Responsible person, though others can assist with the work.
  • A = Accountable : Also known as the approver or final approving authority, this person is answerable for the task&rsquo;s correct and thorough completion. They ensure prerequisites are met and delegate work to the Responsible person. The Accountable person must sign off on the work provided by the Responsible person. There should be only one Accountable person per task or deliverable. This role can be filled by the Responsible person, a technical expert, or a stakeholder.
  • C = Consulted : These individuals offer advice or guidance but do not actively work on the task. They are often subject matter experts who provide input or technical reviews.
  • I = Informed : These are the people kept up-to-date on progress, usually upon task or deliverable completion. Communication with them is one-way.

  📝 IMAGE DESCRIPTION (table):
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  This image represents the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software. It does not contain a table or matrix but instead illustrates the stages of the SDLC in a circular flow diagram.
  
  ### 1. **Table Title/Purpose**:
     - The purpose of this diagram is to outline the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
  
  ### 2. **Column Headers**:
     - Not applicable, as this is not a table.
  
  ### 3. **Row Headers**:
     - Not applicable, as this is not a table.
  
  ### 4. **Data Content**:
     - The diagram shows six stages of the SDLC arranged in a circular flow:
       1. **Planning**: The initial phase where goals, scope, and feasibility are determined.
       2. **Defining**: Requirements are gathered and documented.
       3. **Designing**: The architecture and design of the software are created.
       4. **Building**: The actual development and coding of the software take place.
       5. **Testing**: The software is tested for bugs and issues.
       6. **Deployment**: The software is deployed to production and made available to users.
  
  ### 5. **Legend/Key**:
     - Not applicable, as no legend is present.
  
  ### 6. **Key Insights**:
     - The SDLC is a structured approach to software development.
     - Each stage is interconnected, forming a continuous cycle.
     - The process ensures that software is developed systematically, reducing risks and improving quality.
  
  ### 7. **Notable Cells**:
     - Not applicable, as this is not a table.
  
  ### Additional Notes:
     - This diagram does not represent a RACI matrix or responsibility assignment matrix. It is a conceptual representation of the stages in the SDLC process.
